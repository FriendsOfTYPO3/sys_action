This extension allows to run some TYPO3 backend administration tasks like the
creation of new backend users as a non-admin user if properly set up. It hooks
into the `taskcenter <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/taskcenter/>`__
extension for the GUI part.

The functionality was part of the TYPO3 Core until TYPO3 v10.0, and moved into
its own extension, receiving its own public repository.
